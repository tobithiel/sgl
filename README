SGL - Small OpenGL library

This is supposed to be a small alternative to glut and the various opengl helpers.
One of the main advantages is that you have the control over your main event loop,
which is the reason for its existence.

What it offers:
- window creation
- window resizing
- window closing
- keyboard events
- mouse events
currently supported platforms:
- Linux X11 (incomplete)
- Mac OS X Cocoa (mostly complete)

Build steps:
- mkdir build && cd build
- cmake ..
- make / build VS project under windows

What needs to be done:
- ability to create OpenGL 3 context
- customize pixel format
- scroll wheel
- better thread safety documentation
- windows support
